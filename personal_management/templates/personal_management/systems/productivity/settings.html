    <h3>Productivity System Setup</h3>
    <p class="lead">Activate the execution stack that keeps you focused: timers, reviews, blocking rules, and timeboxing tools.</p>

    <ul class="timeline">
        <li><strong>Pomodoro Timer</strong> — set your preferred focus/break cadence and save defaults.</li>
        <li><strong>Blocking apps & sites</strong> — maintain a list of distractions to import into system-level blockers.</li>
        <li><strong>Weekly & Monthly Reviews</strong> — schedule recurring deep-dives to keep lessons and wins front of mind.</li>
        <li><strong>Big 4 Goals</strong> — flag the annual goals that matter most so they surface inside every review.</li>
        <li><strong>Habit Tracking</strong> — sync Body + Productivity habits and track completions each day.</li>
        <li><strong>Backward Engineering Tool</strong> — map target dates into milestones and work sessions.</li>
        <li><strong>Parkinson Law Tool</strong> — timebox tasks aggressively to prevent scope creep.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="lead">Everything you capture inside these dashboards lives locally until you sync with your knowledge or task system. The intent: fast capture, zero friction, relentless follow-through.</p>
